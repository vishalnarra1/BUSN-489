The things I added from the last upload were my attempts at a chess game for my app development. I uploaded the seperate documents that I made, and am including screen shots below.

I used code from different repositories that I found online, and worked to change the asset images to the chess pieces I like. I plan to implement more functionality such as switching turns and a username/login system in the next few weeks. 
I also did another playground, it didn't run, but I worked on it alongside a tutorial, whcih taught me about optional chaining.
